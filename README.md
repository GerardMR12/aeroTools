# Tools for Aerodynamics Design Studies
Some useful codes for airfoils and wings studies.

- seeAirfoil: simple airfoil profile plot.
- compareAirfoils: compare the width of the several airfoils superposed.
- wingPreStudy: basic information about a wing based on certain measurement contraints. Useful to iterate over preliminary versions of a design.
- wingSurface: this code draws in a 3D plot a wing based on its essential measurements. Includes taper ratio, torsion... Can be represented on real scale or distorted (better visualization).
